## Important Note: PHP Files and GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages **does not support PHP** execution. As a result, you cannot run or execute PHP files directly on GitHub. The PHP code will be shown as plain text files when accessed through GitHub.

To run this project correctly, you'll need to either:

1. **Host the Project on a PHP-Compatible Hosting Service**  
2. **Run the Project Locally Using a Tool Like XAMPP**
